# QR_Algorithm

- Finds all the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix
- Apply similartiy transformation to convert real symmetric matrix to tridiagonal matrix for reducing computational complexity.
- Run unshifted QR algorithm until error is less than 10**-12
- Compute Wilkonson shift for quicker convergence for shifted case
- Compute eigenvalues
